**Description:** In this work we explore some common tasks of modern Computer Vision. We apply classic machine learning algorithms (SVMs) with bag-of-words descriptors and state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to a multi-class classification problem of objects in a Museum (the Met). Since the dataset is highly unbalanced dataset, we explore techniques such as data augmentation. The architectures we use are then adapted to use in a multi-label classification problem.  Finally we explore the usage of CAMs (class activation mapping) to tackle a painting object detection task.
